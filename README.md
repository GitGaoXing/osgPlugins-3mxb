# osgPlugins-3mxb

Load 3MX/3MXB format LOD model files generated by Bentley ContextCapture into OpenSceneGraph.
>NOTE: When using Bentley ContextCapture to generate 3MX format LOD model files, there is always a 3MXB root file generated under the Data folder. We use this 3MXB root file to import the model into OpenSceneGraph.

### Tested Env:
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2017
- OpenSceneGraph-3.6.4 (jpeg is required for loading texture)

### Thirdparty (source codes included for convenience):
- [openCTM-1.0.3](http://openctm.sourceforge.net/)
- [cJsonObject-1.2](https://github.com/Bwar/CJsonObject)
